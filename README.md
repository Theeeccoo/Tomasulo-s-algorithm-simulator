# Tomasulo-s-algorithm-simulator
## A simulator to Tomasulo's Algorithm

Invented by Robert Tomasulo, this scheme was created to remove the hazards found in superscalar processors. It's a Out-of-order issue and commit scheme, which brings us two major things:
* Improvement on IPC (Intructions per clock/cycle);
* More Harzards needs to be controlled in order to prevent execution errors ("Introduces" the WAR and WAW hazards - besides the classical RAW).

To prevent stalls because of the "false" dependencies, Tomasulo's algorithm allows register renaming - provided by _reservations stations_ - ...
