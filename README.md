# Tomasulo's Algorithm Simulator

This project is a simulator for Tomasulo's Algorithm, an innovative solution devised by Robert Tomasulo to address hazards in superscalar processors. The algorithm introduces an out-of-order issue and commit scheme, which offers two significant advantages:

<ol>
    <li> <strong>Improved IPC (Instructions per Clock/Cycle):</strong> By allowing instructions to execute out of order, the algorithm maximizes the utilization of functional units and enhances overall performance. </li>
    <li> <strong>Enhanced Hazard Control:</strong> Tomasulo's Algorithm introduces two additional hazards, WAR (Write After Read) and WAW (Write After Write), in addition to the classical RAW (Read After Write) hazard. By effectively managing these hazards, the algorithm reduces execution errors and ensures accurate results.</li>
</ol>

To prevent stalls caused by false dependencies, Tomasulo's algorithm incorporates **register renaming** through reservation stations. These stations act as intermediate buffers, allowing instructions to operate independently of specific registers and promoting concurrent execution.
